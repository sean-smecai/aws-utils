# AWS Server Management Update Summary

## Overview
We've implemented an automated AWS resource management system to prevent cost overruns by automatically shutting down resources that exceed a specified age threshold.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automated Resource Shutdown**
- **Lambda Function**: Runs on a scheduled basis (daily by default)
- **Age Threshold**: Configurable (default: 3 days)
- **Multi-Region Support**: Scans us-east-1, us-west-2, and ap-southeast-2

### 2. **Supported Resource Types**
- **EC2 Instances**: Stops running instances and adds shutdown tags
- **RDS Databases**: Stops database instances
- **ECS Services**: Scales services down to 0 tasks
- **NAT Gateways**: Deletes gateways to prevent ongoing charges

### 3. **Safety Features**
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test without actually stopping resources
- **Email Notifications**: SNS alerts when resources are shut down
- **Resource Tagging**: Tags resources with shutdown date and reason
- **CloudWatch Logging**: Minimal logging to stay within free tier

### 4. **Recent Optimizations**
- Reduced CloudWatch logging to minimize costs
- Configurable log levels (minimal/verbose)
- 14-day log retention policy
- Optimized for AWS free tier compliance

## Configuration Options

- `MAX_AGE_DAYS`: Days before shutdown (default: 3)
- `DRY_RUN`: Test mode without stopping resources
- `REGIONS`: Comma-separated list of regions to scan
- `LOG_LEVEL`: minimal (default) or verbose

## Deployment

The system is deployed using Terraform with:
- S3 backend for state management
- IAM roles with least-privilege permissions
- EventBridge for scheduled execution
- SNS topic for email notifications

## Cost Savings
This automated system helps prevent unexpected AWS charges by:
- Stopping forgotten test instances
- Cleaning up development resources
- Removing costly NAT gateways
- Preventing long-running database instances

## Recovery
All stopped resources can be easily restarted using standard AWS CLI commands provided in the notification emails.
